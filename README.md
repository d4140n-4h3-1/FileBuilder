# FileBuilder

This is essential for creating an organized file structure for developers and students. This is a great tool for personal Arch and Gentoo Linux builds. However, this will work on any Linux system. 

Templates will be especially useful for quick file creation. 

## Updates

Some major changes have been made. 

* Credits to contributors are listed as "USER _username_ ,", or "_first last_ (USER _username_)" if they so choose. 
* New directories have been added. 
* Directories **programming**, **scripting** and **web** have been moved inside **Documents/dev/**
* Shortcuts have been added. **${KEYWORD}** has been provided for better readability and to shorten some text. 

## Issues

The sections of code intended to write **basic.bas** and **oca.ml** has been temporarily ignored due to output issues. A work-around is required. 

The permanent issue is there is always room for new templates under Line 43, whether it's a script, program, or even a configuration file.
